This software is a client for the 2008 International Probabilistic Planning
Competition (IPPC'08). We used the 'team-1-script.sh' script to test a planner
given as 1st argument on all domains and problems rooted at the directory given
as 2nd argument. We competed with the following algorithms :

  - FSP*-RelaxedDistanceHeuristic: run it with ./team-1-script.sh fsp-rdh /path/to/IPPC08/domains/root
  
  - FSP*-RelaxedBoundsHeuristic: run with ./team-1-script.sh fsp-rbh /path/to/IPPC08/domains/root
  
  - RFF-ProblemGoals: run with ./team-1-script.sh rff-pg /path/to/IPPC08/domains/root
  
  - RFF-BestGoals: run with ./team-1-script.sh rff-bg /path/to/IPPC08/domains/root

Other variants of these algorithms as well as other algorithms can be tested,
for instance VI, LAO* and RTDP, using graph search techniques (flat
representation) or Algebraic Decision Diagrams (factored representation). Many
admissible heuristics are available. The class hierarchy of our implementation
should ease the addition of new algorithms or new heuristics with minimal
effort.

Two programs are provided with this package:

  - plannerclient: client for the IPPC'08 server 'mdpsim'
  
  - plannertest: standalone program used to test and directly compare different algorithms
  
Please read the help of these programs for more details (<program-name> -- help).

To compile the package, you need to install the following packages:

  - libtoolized version of mdpsim
  
  - CUDD for Algebraic Decision Diagrams (download it at
    ftp://vlsi.colorado.edu/pub/cudd-2.4.2.tar.gz) Please note that none of our
    competition planners used CUDD since they are all based on a (flat) state
    graph representation. You can of course run our competition algorithms with
    factored representation (using CUDD for ADD encodings) and compare the
    performances with the state graph representation...
  
  - the FF planner for RFF (download it at http://members.deri.at/~joergh/ff/FF-v2.3.tgz)
  
To install the package, you need to type the following command in a terminal window:

  ./configure --prefix <path-to-installation-directory> --with-cudd-prefix=<path-cudd-compilation-directory>
         --with-mdpsim-prefix=<path-to-mdpsim-installation-directory> --with-ff-command=<path-to-ff-command>
  make
  make install
  
Enjoy!
