This directory contains the C implementation of FF-v2.3, as it was
used in the 3rd international planning competition. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

ff

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,

Joerg Hoffmann


IMPORTANT NOTE:

FF is known to compile without problems on any Unix/Linux platform,
*except* for the Bison/Flex technology used in the PDDL parser, which
often creates problems due to lack of downwards compatibility. The
code contained herein does compile in the following setting:

hoffmann@mpino2302:~/FF-v2.3$ /usr/bin/bison --version
bison (GNU Bison) 1.875d
